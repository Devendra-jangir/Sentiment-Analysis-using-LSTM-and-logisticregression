# Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM-and-logisticregression
I have created a model using both machine and  deep learning algoritham. This model name is "Twitter sentiment analysis " that will show you that Twitter comment is positive or negative.  In this i have used both deep and machine learning to check which one is good for this. LSTM model is giving good accuracy.
